%%_PROJECT_NAME_%% : A simple skelton of application for Kahua.

[Requirements]

Gauche-0.8.9 or later
Kahua-1.0.1 or later

[Installation]

  % ./DIST gen
  % ./configure [any options if you need]

You have to give some options to specify the same install directories 
as Kahua installed. For example if you gave --prefix=$HOME to 
configure script of Kahua when you installed it, you have to give the 
same option to kahua-web's configure script.

  % ./configure --prefix=$HOME

And then

  % make
  % make check
  % make install

Then, edit app-servers in the Kahua working directory to add "%%_PROJECT_NAME_%%" entry.

  (%%_PROJECT_NAME_%% :arguments () :run-by-default 1)

[Information]

You can find some %%_PROJECT_NAME_%%'s information at the Kahua.org site.
